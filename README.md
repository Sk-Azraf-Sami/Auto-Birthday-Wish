Welcome to the Automatic Birthday Wishing Script project! This project aims to automatically send birthday wishes to your friends and acquaintances, ensuring they feel remembered and appreciated on their special day.

## Project Story

In September 05, 2022, I began my journey into the world of JavaScript, eager to explore its capabilities. Through my exploration, I discovered Google Apps Script, a powerful tool that allows me to write JavaScript to interact with Google Sheets and customize HTML files. <br/>
The inspiration for this project came from a funny clip from **Mr. Bean**, where Mr. Bean wishes himself a happy birthday. It was both funny and sad. In this world, there are many people who celebrate their birthday alone, with no one to wish or remember their special day. </br>

Inspired by the idea of ensuring no friend goes unnoticed on their birthday, I embarked on creating a script that would automatically send birthday wishes to my school, college, and university friends.

- Utilizes Google Sheets to store friend's information, including name, email address, birthday date, and confirmation of whether an email has been sent.
- Automates the process of sending birthday wishes via email to friends stored in the Google Sheets.
- Configurable triggers to activate the script at specified times.

## How to Use

1. **Google Sheet Setup**: Create a Google Sheet with columns for name, email address, birthday date, and email sent confirmation.

2. **[Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) Integration**: Write JavaScript code using Google Apps Script to read data from the Google Sheet, process birthdays, and send emails.

3. **Trigger Configuration**: Set up triggers in Google Apps Script to activate the script at specific times. Use the following steps to configure triggers:
   - Access the Apps Script editor.
   - Navigate to Edit > Current project's triggers.
   - Click on Add Trigger.
   - Choose the function to trigger, event source, and deployment target.
   - Set the desired time-driven trigger to activate the script daily at a specific time, adjusting for GMT+06 (Bangladeshi time).

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the script as a web app to enable email sending functionality. Ensure appropriate permissions are granted for accessing Google Sheets and sending emails.
